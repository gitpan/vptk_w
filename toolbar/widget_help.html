<b>  Visual Perl/Tk editor (widget edition)</b>

               Revision 1.17

  (by Felix Liberman - FelixL@Rambler.ru)

This editor can help any unexperienced in programming user
to create widget-based Perl/Tk application.
It can be a 'long brush' tool for user interface sketching.

<b>  1. Main menu</b>

All editing functions can be called from main menu:
<b>File Insert Edit View      Help</b>

<b>File</b>
File menu interact with design reading/storing and
output format.

<b>Note:</b>
There are two possible ways to use generated design
- Generate fully executable code and run it as standalone script
- Generate code for subwindow using $mw as base window
In second case user can embed his design in dialog box or
control panel.

<b>Insert</b>
User can (near) free insert each widget inside of
others. Although it's not recommended to insert sub-widgets
inside of 'regular' widgets. Really useful containers are
Frame, NoteBookFrame and LabFrame.

During insertion some geometry collisions may occour.
Refer to 'Geometry' chapter of this manual for details.

Widgets that can be inserted under regular containers:
- Frame
- Label
- Button
- Entry
- Text
- Listbox
- LabEntry
- LabFrame
- Scale
- Optionmenu
- Message
- BrowseEntry
- Radiobutton
- Checkbutton
- Menubutton
- packAdjust (Adjustor)
- NoteBook

Notebook can contain only NoteBookFrames
Menubutton can contain one and only one Menu
Menu can contain:
- command
- cascade
- checkbutton
- radiobutton
- separator

<b>  2. Toolbar</b>

Some commonly used actions can be invoked using toolbar buttons.
Holding mouse pointer on such button you can read popup help message.

<b>  3. Keyboard shortcuts</b>

There are also keyboard shortcuts for main commands:
  Ctrl/Z - Undo
  Ctrl/R - Redo
  Ctrl/O - File Open
  Ctrl/S - File Save
   DEL   - Delete

<b>  4. Mouse</b>

Mouse functions:

  Left button - select object under cursor
  Left button double-click - edit object properties
  Right button - call pop-up menu for this object

This mapping works both in design tree list and in
preview window.

Exclusion:
Actions in preview window can cause callback function
to run, thus (for VPTK application safety) calls to
real functions replaced with message box popup.

<b>  5. Hierarhy</b>

  Due to modular character of Tk geometry manager your
project must have hierarhy structure: each widget may
have father (container), brothers (neighbor widgets
sitting in same container) and children (sub-widgets).

  Note that brother widgets must use same geometry
manager. Conflicts of such type automatically detected
and resolved by VPTK.

<b>  6. Status bar</b>

  In the bottom of editor window located status bar, displaying
ID of currently selected object, mouse (X,Y) coordinates and
modification flag

<b>NOTE:</b>
When going back with 'undo' to state before 1st modification
the flag remain 'dirty' :-(

<b>  7. Geometry conflicts and Tk glitches</b>

  What is geometry conflict? First of all it's mix of different
geometry managers under same parent widget. Additional restriction
(possible deviated from first one) Tk geometry manager gets
mad if user tryes to use 'grid' geometry under frame with label.

  Yet another geometry conflict source: when some widget use
packAdjust 'sub-widget' while 'brothers' use non-pack
geometry managers. No solution till now (simply avoid such
situations - otherwise application became stuck).

  As noted in chapter 5, this type of conflicts arise only
for widgets placed on the same level in same container.

  More Tk glitches that recommended to consider:
  - when baloons assigned to some widgets Tk goes mad after
the widget clicked (fixed in latest Tk releases);
  - baloons not working in dialog windows - only in top-level;
  - color dialog can't be called from dailog window.

<b>  8. Additional (but not less important) notes</b>

  Your 'hand-written' source code in most cases can't be read-in
by this program. This 'feature' appears due to limitations in
source code format suggested by author for internal use.
Please do not save partially interpreted code over original one.

  This apply to users that generated some code and manually
changed it from outside of VPTK. Latest VPTK version allow
much more flexibility with nearly full set of widget options,
variables and callback subroutines support + freestyle user-side
code (mainly for callbacks) that can be edited from VPTK and
stored safely. Thus I'll recommend to preserve generated
part unchanged for future editing purposes.

  My program developed for "fair use" suggesting that user would
not try intentionally damage any data. From my side done all the
best in order to supply powerful 'undo' mechanisms for such cases
elimination. All bug reports are welcomed and will be served ASAP.

  You can contact me, download updated versions of this program
and other FREE software from my site http://felix.da.ru

  Thanks a lot to all customers that send me advices and
suggestions.

  Thanks to PerlTk.ORG web-site for publishing my dilettante
artwork among real PerlTk classics.
