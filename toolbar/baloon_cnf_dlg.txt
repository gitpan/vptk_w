causes the window to stay resized to the grid created by the widget. 
Essentially, this means that the widget will display only complete lines 
(no half lines) and complete characters.

 -accelerator => text
The -accelerator option allows you to place a text string to the right of the 
text or image displayed in the menu. The string usually contains a clue to a 
quick-key combination that will execute the command associated 
with the menu item. Example: <Ctrl/Z>

 -show => char

Used to choose line length for text if width option isn't specified. Defaults to 150.

 -variable => variable pointer
Specifies name of global variable to set whenever this widget is selected. 
Changes in this variable also cause the widget to change itself look.

 -value => text
Specifies value to store in the widget's associated variable whenever this widget 
is selected. This field is obligatory for correct Radiobuttons functionality

 -offvalue => text
Specifies value to store in the button's associated variable whenever this button 
is deselected.  Defaults to ``0''.

 -onvalue => text
Specifies value to store in the button's associated variable whenever this button 
is selected.  Defaults to ``1''.

 -command => subroutine pointer
Specifies the callback routine to be associated with the widget main action
(select, double-click, 'return' key, etc.) See specific TkPOD help for
each widget.

 -textvariable => variable pointer
Specifies the name of a variable. The value of the variable is a text string to be 
displayed inside the widget; if the variable value changes then the widget will 
automatically update itself to reflect the new value. The way in which the string 
is displayed in the widget depends on the particular widget and may be determined 
by other options, such as anchor or justify.

 -state => 'normal' | 'active' | 'disabled'
Determines the state of the widget and whether or not the user can interact with it.
Default is 'normal'.  

 -tickinterval => value
Describes the labels drawn by the right (or on the bottom) of the scale.

if the widget is selected and raised otherwise.

 -selectcolor => color
Specifies a background color to use when the button is selected. If indicatorOn is true 
then the color applies to the indicator. If indicatorOn is false, this color is used as 
the background for the entire widget, in place of background or activeBackground, 
whenever the widget is selected.

 -selectmode => single | browse | multiple | extended
Specifies one of several styles for manipulating the selection. The value of the option 
may be arbitrary, but the default bindings expect it to be either single, browse, 
multiple, or extended;  the default value is browse.

 -wrap =>  none | char | word
A wrap mode of none means that each line of text appears as exactly one line on the 
screen; extra characters that don't fit on the screen are not displayed. In the other
modes each line of text will be broken up into several screen lines if necessary to
keep all the characters visible: char mode - a screen line break may occur after any
character, word mode - a line break at word boundaries.

 -createcmd => subroutine pointer
Specifies a callback to be called the first time the page is shown on the screen. 
This option can be used to delay the creation of the contents of a page until 
necessary. It can be useful in situations where there are a large number of pages 
in a NoteBook widget; 

 -raisecmd => subroutine pointer
Specifies a callback to be called whenever this page is raised by the user.
